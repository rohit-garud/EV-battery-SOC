# EV-battery-SOC
 Repository for implementations of the state of charge (SOC) estimation of the electric vehicle (EV) battery using different methods including machine learning-based approaches

 ## Methods of SOC Estimation
 SOC estimation methods can be mainly classified as follows. There are several methods in each category.
 ### Direct Measurement-Based Methods
 - Open Circuit Voltage (OCV)
 - Electromotive Force (EMF)
 - Internal Resistance (IR)
 - Impedance Spectroscopy (IS)

### Book Keeping Estimation Methods
- Coulomb Counting and its Variations

### Model-Based Methods
- Adaptive Filters (AF)
  - H Infinity Filter (H$\infty$F)
  - Kalman Filter
    - Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
    - Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)
    - Sigma Point Kalman Filter (SPKF)
  - Particle Filter (PF)
  - Recursive Least Square Filter (RLSF)
- Observer-Based Estimation (OBE)
  - Non-linear Observer (NLO)
  - Sliding Mode Observer (SMO)
    - Adaptive Switching Gain Sliding Mode Observer (ASGSMO)
    - Super Twisting Sliding Mode Observer (STSMO)
    - Fractional Order Sliding Mode Observer (FOSMO)
  - Proportional Integral Observer (PIO)
  - Luenberger-based Observer (LO)

### Computer Intelligence-Based Methods
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (BFA)
